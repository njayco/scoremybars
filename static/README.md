## 🎯 For Beginners

**Think of it like this**:
- **HTML** (templates folder) = The skeleton of the website
- **CSS** = The clothes and makeup that make it look good
- **JavaScript** = The brain that makes it interactive

**Key Learning Points**:
- CSS controls appearance and layout
- JavaScript handles user interactions and data
- Both work together to create a complete user experience
- The browser runs all this code locally (on your computer/phone)

**File Relationships**:
- `templates/index.html` loads `static/css/style.css` and `static/js/main.js`
- `main.js` communicates with `app.py` (the server)
- `style.css` makes everything look professional and responsive
