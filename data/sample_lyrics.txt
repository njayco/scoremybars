[Intro]
Yo, this is ScoreMyBars
Let's see what you got

[Verse 1]
I'm in the studio, cooking up the heat
Every bar I spit, got the crowd on their feet
Metaphors so deep, they can't compete
Wordplay so fresh, it's a lyrical treat
Double entendres, they don't see it coming
Punchlines so hard, got the audience humming
Internal rhymes, the flow is stunning
This is art, and I'm the one running

[Chorus]
Score my bars, let's see what you got
AI analysis, give it all you've got
From the cleverness to the radio spot
This is hip-hop, and we're taking the top

[Verse 2]
From boom bap to trap, I can do it all
Commercial appeal, but still keeping it raw
This is the future, breaking every wall
ScoreMyBars, we're answering the call
Rhyme schemes so complex, they can't decode
Every syllable placed, every word bestowed
This is the craft, this is the code
In the game of words, I'm the one who's owed

[Bridge]
Listen to the rhythm, feel the beat
Every word I say, got the crowd on repeat
This is more than music, this is poetry
ScoreMyBars, setting the industry free

[Outro]
That's how you do it
ScoreMyBars, baby
